title: About
---

I'm Ian Muscat. I am a technophile with a special interest in web technologies working and living on the island of [Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta){:target="_blank"}.

I spend most of my time making things, breaking things and reading about new technology. My areas of interest include information security, mobile first website development and website performance.

When my head is not buried in a shell, I enjoy spicy food, [listening to music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk){:target="_blank"}, [inspiring graphic design](http://www.paul-rand.com){:target="_blank"} and [awesome films](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622){:target="_blank"}.
